# React Projects with Tailwind CSS

This repository contains a collection of React projects that are originally created by [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-projects) but with the CSS replaced by Tailwind CSS. All credit for the original project ideas and code goes to him.

I created this repository as a learning exercise for myself and wanted to share it with others who may find it helpful. If you want to learn React, I highly recommend checking out John Smilga's original repository.

Thank you, John Smilga, for creating these amazing React projects! As a web developer, I have learned so much from your work.
